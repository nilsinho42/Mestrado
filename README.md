# Cloud-Based Object Detection and Flow Analysis

This research project analyzes cloud-based solutions for object detection and counting to determine the flow of people and vehicles using Computer Vision and MLOps techniques. The project compares cost, quality, and performance across AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms.
